 * - BASE: 完整对话压缩（替换全部历史为摘要）
 * - PARTIAL: 部分压缩（早期消息保留，仅压缩最近消息）
 *
 * 此外提供 NO_TOOLS_PREAMBLE 用于强制纯文本响应（避免在缓存共享的 fork 中 模型尝试调用工具浪费回合）。

   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns

     - file names
     - full code snippets

4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.`;
